This is a demo of the experiments performed for the paper "Semantic Segmentation of Seismic Images Based on Self-Supervised Learning from Few-Labeled Samples", submitted to the special stream of IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing letters at Sibgrapi 2022.

In this Demo it is possible to visualize the already trained models for 1 and 5 shots, and also to fine-tune with 1 to 6 shots. 

So far, only a few samples of the open dataset Netherlands F3 Block are available. The full volume of data can be obtained at:
